what should be done next:
take the jsons from the drive (rivers, saddles, peaks, cliffs) and put them in data/overpass_classes_data ( if it still does not work - take them from topo2vec_ilay)

take the final models from the drive and put them in the final_model folder

run the calc_accuracies, knn_random_vs_classes experiments as they are the most important
